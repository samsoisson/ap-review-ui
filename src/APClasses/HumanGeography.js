course introduces students to the systematic study of patterns and processes that have shaped human understanding, use, and
alteration of Earthâ€™s surface. Students employ spatial concepts and landscape analysis to analyze human social organization and
its environmental consequences. They also learn the methods and tools geographers use in their science and practice. It is the
study of people from a spatial and ecological perspective. A college text will be utilized, and the emphasis is placed upon critical
thinking, independent study, and research."</p>
